# Introduction
We present a new AAC framework capable of dealing with streaming scenarios. 

The framework combines AAS and ISA (Smith-Miles, 2022) in a AAC context.

Manuel Lopez-Ibanez et al developed the first version of irace in 2016.

A large uncertainty in the relationship between instance features, hyperparameters, and algorithmic performance makes AAC a hard problem.
